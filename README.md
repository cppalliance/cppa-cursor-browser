# Cursor Chat Browser (Python)

A Python web application for browsing and managing chat histories from the Cursor editor's AI chat feature. View, search, and export your AI conversations in various formats.

Inspired by [cursor-chat-browser](https://github.com/thomas-pedersen/cursor-chat-browser) (Node.js). This Python rewrite was created for easier maintenance and to add additional features such as CLI zip export, richer Markdown frontmatter, and a zero-build-step frontend.

## Features

- Browse and search all workspaces with Cursor chat history
- Support for both workspace-specific and global storage (newer Cursor versions)
- **Cursor CLI agent sessions** — browses and exports sessions from `cursor agent` (stored in `~/.cursor/chats/`)
- View AI chat and Composer/Agent logs
- Organize chats by workspace/project
- Full-text search with filters for chat/composer logs
- Responsive design with dark/light mode support
- Export chats as Markdown, HTML, PDF, JSON, or CSV
- **CLI export** with zip archive support and incremental (`--since last`) mode
- Syntax highlighted code blocks
- Bookmarkable chat URLs
- Automatic workspace path detection

## Samples

This repo includes a real exported conversation and a few screenshots so you can quickly see what the Projects list, Search, conversation view, and one-click export look like.

- **Example chat export (Markdown)**: [`samples/example_chat_export.md`](samples/example_chat_export.md) (includes YAML frontmatter + transcript, with tool calls / thinking blocks when present)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A Cursor editor installation with chat history

## Installation

```bash
cd cursor-chat-browser-python
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For development (pytest, mypy, Hypothesis property tests):

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For reproducible installs (same versions as CI), use the pinned lock file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-lock.txt
```

### Dependency bounds and lock file

Runtime version **bounds** live in `pyproject.toml` under `[project.dependencies]` (`flask`, `fpdf2`, `pillow`, etc.). `requirements.txt` mirrors those specifiers for backward compatibility — keep them identical when you change deps.

**CI** installs from `requirements-lock.txt`, which pins exact versions (including transitive packages). The lock is produced on **Linux** (same as CI and `update-lock.yml`); `pip-compile` on Windows may add platform-only pins such as `colorama` — do not commit those.

Regenerate after editing bounds (prefer **Actions → Update dependency lock file → Run workflow**, or on Linux / WSL):

```bash
pip install pip-tools
pip-compile requirements.txt \
  --output-file requirements-lock.txt \
  --no-header \
  --annotation-style=line \
  --allow-unsafe
```

Then restore the comment header at the top of `requirements-lock.txt` (see the existing file) and commit both `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` and `requirements-lock.txt`.

**Automated updates:**

- **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) — weekly PRs for `pip` and `github-actions` when newer versions fit the declared bounds. Merging a Dependabot **pip** PR does **not** refresh the lock file; run the lock workflow or `pip-compile` locally afterward.
- **Update dependency lock file** (`.github/workflows/update-lock.yml`) — scheduled Mondays 08:00 UTC (and manual **Actions → Run workflow**) runs `pip-compile --upgrade` and opens a PR with an updated `requirements-lock.txt`.

## Quick Start (Web UI)

```bash
python app.py
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.

The Werkzeug debugger is **off by default** and must be opted in explicitly via the `--debug` flag or by setting `FLASK_DEBUG=1`. (Note: `FLASK_ENV=development` is **not** consulted - only `FLASK_DEBUG` is. See issue #9 for the rationale.)

## Deployment

For production WSGI servers (gunicorn, waitress), threading constraints, multi-process caveats, and path-configuration trust boundaries, see **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

## Tests

Run the full suite from the repository root (install `requirements-lock.txt` or `requirements.txt` first):

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests -v
```

Run a single module, for example:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_cli_args -v
```

## CLI Export

Export chat history to Markdown without starting the web server. Running with no arguments exports **everything** (all chats + composer logs) as a zip archive into the current directory.

```bash
# Export everything (zip) into the current directory — the most common usage
python scripts/export.py

# Export only chats updated since the last export, save zip to a specific folder
python scripts/export.py --since last --out /path/to/folder

# Export as individual Markdown files instead of a zip
python scripts/export.py --no-zip --out ./my-export

# Export only chat logs (exclude composer logs)
python scripts/export.py --no-composer
```

### CLI Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--since all` | Export all chats | `all` |
| `--since last` | Export only chats updated since last export | |
| `--out DIR` | Output directory | `.` (current directory) |
| `--no-zip` | Write individual Markdown files instead of a zip archive | zip on |
| `--no-composer` | Exclude composer logs (export only chat logs) | included |
| `--help` | Show help and exit | |

### Output

- **Zip mode** (default): A single `cursor-export-YYYY-MM-DD.zip` file containing all Markdown files organized by date, workspace, and chat.
- **File mode** (`--no-zip`): Individual Markdown files at `<out>/YYYY-MM-DD/<workspace>/chat/<timestamp>__<title>__<id>.md`, plus a `manifest.jsonl` index.
- Each Markdown file includes YAML frontmatter (log ID, title, timestamps, message count, model, token usage, tool calls, etc.) and the full conversation transcript.
- IDE chats are written under `<workspace>/chat/`; Cursor CLI agent sessions are written under `<workspace>/cli/`.
- If the Cursor IDE database is absent (e.g. on a machine with only `cursor agent` installed), only CLI sessions are exported — the script no longer exits with an error.

Export state is saved to `~/.cursor-chat-browser/export_state.json` so that `--since last` works across runs.

## Configuration

The application automatically detects your Cursor workspace storage location:

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage` |
| WSL2 | `/mnt/c/Users/<USERNAME>/AppData/Roaming/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage` |
| Linux (SSH) | `~/.cursor-server/data/User/workspaceStorage` |

To override, set the `WORKSPACE_PATH` environment variable or use the Configuration page in the web UI. API-validated paths vs trusted env-var overrides are documented in **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md#path-configuration)**.

Cursor CLI agent sessions are read from `~/.cursor/chats/` (the default path used by the `cursor agent` CLI). Override with the `CLI_CHATS_PATH` environment variable.

## Desktop App (Windows .exe)

You can package the browser as a standalone desktop application with its own window - no Python installation required on the target machine.

### Build

```bash
pip install pywebview pyinstaller
pyinstaller cursor-browser.spec
```

This produces `dist/CursorChatBrowser/` containing `CursorChatBrowser.exe` and its supporting files. Move the folder anywhere you like, then pin the `.exe` to Start or the taskbar.

The desktop app uses [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/) to render the Flask UI inside a native window via Edge WebView2 (pre-installed on Windows 10/11). No HTTP server or port is opened - pywebview calls the WSGI app directly in-process. See **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md#desktop-mode-pywebview)** for threading details.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3, Flask
- **Database:** sqlite3 (built-in) — reads Cursor's SQLite databases directly
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no npm, no build step)
- **PDF:** fpdf2

## Versioning

> **Merge note:** The full policy and `CHANGELOG.md` ship in [PR #85](https://github.com/cppalliance/cppa-cursor-browser/pull/85) (#74). Land that PR with or before this one to avoid duplicate or dead links.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

**Pre-1.0 stability (current):** The project is at `0.x.y`. During this phase:

- **Minor version bumps (`0.x` → `0.x+1`)** may include breaking changes to the HTTP API, CLI flags, or exported file formats. Consumers of the `/api/*` endpoints or the `cursor-chat-export` CLI should review the changelog before upgrading.
- **Patch version bumps (`0.x.y` → `0.x.y+1`)** are backward-compatible bug fixes only. Critical security fixes may break compatibility at any version with appropriate changelog notation.

**What constitutes a breaking change:**

| Surface | Breaking examples |
|---|---|
| HTTP API | Removing or renaming an endpoint; changing the JSON schema of a response in a non-additive way |
| CLI (`cursor-chat-export`) | Removing or renaming a flag; changing default output structure |
| Export formats | Removing YAML frontmatter fields; changing the zip directory layout |

Internal Python modules are not a semver-governed library API for external importers.

Adding new optional fields to JSON responses, adding new CLI flags with sensible defaults, or adding new export-format sections are *not* considered breaking.

Notable changes will be documented in **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format (see #74 / PR #85).

When an API surface is scheduled for removal, follow the process in **[docs/API_DEPRECATION.md](docs/API_DEPRECATION.md)** (response headers, changelog entries, minimum notice period).
