## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Summary disk cache (Phase 3)** — project list and tab summaries cached under
  `~/.cache/cursor-chat-browser/`, invalidated when global or per-workspace DB
  mtimes change; bypass with `?nocache=1` or `CURSOR_CHAT_BROWSER_NOCACHE=1` (#84)
- **Lazy-load workspace UI** — workspace sidebar renders from a lightweight summary
  payload; full bubble content is fetched per-conversation when the user selects it,
  reducing first-paint time from 1–2 min to < 3 s on large local fixtures (#84)
- **`GET /api/workspaces/<id>/tabs?summary=1`** — new summary-only variant returns
  `id`, `title`, `timestamp`, `messageCount`, and optional `metadata.modelsUsed`
  without loading any bubble data (#84)
- **`GET /api/workspaces/<id>/tabs/<composer_id>`** — new single-conversation
  endpoint loads only scoped `bubbleId:{id}:%`, `messageRequestContext:{id}:%`,
  and `codeBlockDiff:{id}:%` KV rows, avoiding a full global bubble scan (#84)
- **Scoped KV loaders** in `services/workspace_db.py`:
  `load_bubbles_for_composer`, `load_message_request_context_for_composer`,
  `load_code_block_diffs_for_composer` — used by the single-tab path (#84)

### Changed
- **Workspace load performance (phase 2)** — project list and workspace summaries
  no longer read every ``composerData`` JSON blob from global storage; mapped
  composers are fetched by id, unmapped composers are discovered via a key-only
  scan; per-workspace sidebar loads only composers mapped to that workspace;
  ``composer_id → workspace`` disk cache no longer invalidates on global DB writes
- **Workspace load performance** — sidebar summaries skip composers definitively
  mapped to other workspaces (avoid JSON parse/heuristics on unrelated chats);
  batched `messageRequestContext` layout loading replaces per-composer N+1
  queries on list/summary paths
- **List-path performance** — skip full `messageRequestContext` scan unless
  invalid workspace aliases are needed; filter `composerData` in SQL; skip
  `Composer.from_dict` on list/summary paths; cache `composer_id_to_ws` mapping (#84)
- **`GET /api/workspaces`** (`list_workspace_projects`) no longer performs a
  global `bubbleId:%` scan; conversation presence is determined from
  `fullConversationHeadersOnly` headers alone, and workspace assignment relies
  on `composer_id_to_ws` (primary) plus `projectLayouts` from MRC (#84)
- **`assemble_workspace_tabs`** inner per-composer loop refactored into a shared
  `_assemble_tab_from_composer_data` helper reused by `assemble_single_tab`; full
  path behaviour is unchanged (#84)

### Deprecated
- Direct use of `GET /api/workspaces/<id>/tabs` (no `?summary=1`) from the workspace
  UI on page load; the UI now calls `?summary=1` for first paint and lazy-fetches
  individual tabs. The full-assembly endpoint remains available for export,
  search, and backward-compatible consumers (planned removal: post-1.0) (#84)


- **Web UI** — browse and search all Cursor AI workspaces; conversation view with syntax-highlighted code blocks, dark/light mode, and bookmarkable chat URLs (#63)
- **Export formats** — one-click export of chats as Markdown, HTML, PDF, JSON, and CSV from the web UI (#63)
- **CLI export** (`cursor-chat-export` / `scripts/export.py`) — zip archive or individual Markdown files with YAML frontmatter; incremental mode (`--since last`) preserves state across runs (#63, #42, #61)
- **Cursor CLI agent session support** — browse and export sessions stored in `~/.cursor/chats/` by the `cursor agent` CLI; gracefully degrades when the IDE database is absent (#7, #8, #63)
- **Desktop app packaging** — Windows `.exe` via PyInstaller + pywebview; no Python installation required on the target machine (#63)
- **Type-safe models** with schema validation at SQLite read boundaries (#24, #30)
- **CI matrix** (Linux / macOS / Windows) running pytest, mypy, and gitleaks (#13, #19, #44, #62)
- **Python packaging infrastructure** (`pyproject.toml` with hatchling, bounded dependency pins, `requirements-lock.txt`, Dependabot) (#45, #47, #49, #53)
- Optional exclusion rules for sensitive projects and chats (#1, #2)
- Full-text search with workspace and log-type filters (#63)
- Hypothesis property-based tests for blob and bubble parsing (#71, #81)
- PDF export endpoint coverage in CI (#72)

### Changed
- Extract shared `from_dict` validation helpers for model classes, reducing duplication (#70, #80)
- Enable mypy `strict-optional` and fix nullability gaps across the codebase (#69, #79)

### Fixed
- Path traversal and symlink-escape protection on `/api/set-workspace` (#15, #22)
- Disabled Werkzeug debug mode by default; opt-in via `--debug` / `FLASK_DEBUG=1` (#9, #20)
- Sanitise Marked.js HTML output with DOMPurify (#11, #21)
- Wrapped all production `sqlite3.connect()` calls in context managers (#17, #23)
- Skip NULL bubble rows in workspace tabs loader (#50, #52)
- Thread-unsafe `_workspace_path_override` race condition (#43, #54)
- Normalise Windows-style paths on non-Windows hosts (#8)
- Add incomplete-result signaling on parse failure so callers can distinguish partial vs. complete data (#67, #78)
- Replace `print()` error output with structured logging throughout (#68, #77)
- Replace silent `except Exception: pass` with structured logging in workspace and bubble load paths (#66, #76)
- Decouple API handlers from private `_`-prefixed service internals (#73)
